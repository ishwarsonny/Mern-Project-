        <p className="mb-4">
          Welcome to Leheriya, where every purchase tells a story of empowerment, tradition, and compassion.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          At Leheriya, we believe in more than just fashion; we believe in the power of human connection and the preservation of cultural heritage. Our journey began with a simple yet profound mission: to uplift the lives of artisans and weavers in India while bringing their exquisite creations to the world stage.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Inspired by the vibrant tapestry of Indian culture and the rich legacy of traditional craftsmanship, we set out on a quest to make a difference. We witnessed firsthand the talent, dedication, and resilience of the artisans and weavers who pour their hearts and souls into every thread, every stitch, and every pattern.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Yet, despite their extraordinary skills, many of these artisans faced immense challenges – from exploitation by middlemen to lack of access to fair wages and sustainable livelihoods. We knew that something had to change, and we were determined to be a part of that change.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          At Leheriya, we made a commitment to source our products directly from these talented artisans and weavers, cutting out the middlemen and ensuring that they receive fair compensation for their incredible work. By establishing transparent and ethical partnerships with artisan communities across India, we empower them to preserve their traditional crafts, support their families, and build brighter futures for generations to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every product you find at Leheriya tells a story of hope, resilience, and transformation. From the intricate handloom fabrics woven by skilled artisans in Varanasi to the vibrant leheriya patterns crafted by master craftsmen in Rajasthan, each piece is a testament to the beauty of Indian craftsmanship and the power of conscious consumerism.
